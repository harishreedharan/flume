/**
 * <p>
 * A {@link Source} implementation that executes a Unix process and turns each
 * line of text into an event.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This source runs a given Unix command on start up and expects that process to
 * continuously produce data on standard out (stderr is simply discarded). If
 * the process exits for any reason, the source also exits and will produce no
 * further data. This means configurations such as <tt>cat [named pipe]</tt> or
 * <tt>tail -F [file]</tt> are going to produce the desired results where as
 * <tt>date</tt> will probably not - the former two commands produce streams of
 * data where as the latter produces a single event and exits.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The <tt>ExecSource</tt> is meant for situations where one must integrate with
 * existing systems without modifying code. It is a compatibility gateway built
 * to allow simple, stop-gap integration and doesn't necessarily offer all of
 * the benefits or guarantees of native integration with Flume. If one has the
 * option of using the <tt>AvroSource</tt>, for instance, that would be greatly
 * preferred to this source as it (and similarly implemented sources) can
 * maintain the transactional guarantees that exec can not.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <i>Why doesn't <tt>ExecSource</tt> offer transactional guarantees?</i>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The problem with <tt>ExecSource</tt> and other asynchronous sources is that
 * the source can not guarantee that if there is a failure to put the event into
 * the {@link Channel} the client knows about it. As a for instance, one of the
 * most commonly requested features is the <tt>tail -F [file]</tt>-like use case
 * where an application writes to a log file on disk and Flume tails the file,
 * sending each line as an event. While this is possible, there's an obvious
 * problem; what happens if the channel fills up and Flume can't send an event?
 * Flume has no way of indicating to the application writing the log file that
 * it needs to retain the log or that the event hasn't been sent, for some
 * reason. If this doesn't make sense, you need only know this: <b>Your
 * application can never guarantee data has been received when using a
 * unidirectional asynchronous interface such as ExecSource!</b> As an extension
 * of this warning - and to be completely clear - there is absolutely zero
 * guarantee of event delivery when using this source. You have been warned.
